    name: API City Conference
    description: |-
      API City Conference is a non-profit community event that brings together a diverse set of developers and business people to network and learn about APIs and the business value they can bring to you and your company. With a focus on diversity and accessibility, our 3 track conference creates an open event where everyone is welcome.
      Our 2018 event is being held at the Kitsap Conference Center from October 3rd - October 4th. The venue is located on the waterfront in Bremerton, WA and just one block from the ferry terminal. We are expecting 400 attendees this year. In addition to a great line-up of speakers, we will be providing live captioning in the main room for people hard of hearing, and a Women &amp; Non-Binary luncheon event. We hope you can join us for our inaugural event this Fall!

    description: |-
      If you&rsquo;re a tech company, you are likely publishing or consuming API&rsquo;s already.&nbsp;API World is the first large-scale conference and expo with the goal of organizing this new API Economy. The API World 2018 Conference and Expo was created with the mission to be neutral and facilitate connections, knowledge, trust and business within the developer community of API providers and consumers. If you are a coder, a startup or an enterprise that consumes or provides multiple APIs this is your event.
      Decentralization: The move to APIs follows a technology-wide trend towards decentralization that includes Agile methodologies and the DevOps movement. Beyond the decentralization of public web services, we are seeking the decoupling of monolithic API infrastructure into microservices. The rise of containers and kubernetes for rapid deployment, scalability, orchestration of microservices moves us further towards decentralization. The new movements towards API and microservice protocols and serverless architecture reinforces this move towards decentralization. The theme of API World 2018 is the move towards decentralization of both public-facing and internal API architecture.
      The next conference is September 10&ndash;12, 2018 | San Jose Convention Center.

    name: Kafka Summit
    description: As streaming platforms become central to data strategies, companies
      both small and large are re-thinking their architecture with real-time context
      at the forefront. Monoliths are evolving into Microservices. Datacenters are moving
      to the cloud. What was once a &lsquo;batch&rsquo; mindset is quickly being replaced
      with stream processing as the demands of the business impose more and more real-time
      requirements on developers and architects. This revolution is transforming industries.
      What started at companies like LinkedIn, Uber, Netflix and Yelp has made its way
      to countless others in a variety of sectors. Today, thousands of companies across
      the globe build their businesses on top of Apache Kafka&reg;. The developers responsible
      for this revolution need a place to share their experiences on this journey. Kafka
      Summit is the premier event for data architects, engineers, devops professionals,
      and developers who want to learn about streaming data. It brings the Apache Kafka
      community together to share best practices, write code, and discuss the future
      of streaming technologies.

    description: |-
      REST Fest is an unconference developed by Mike Amundsen and Benjamin Young. Our objective is to give people interested in REST, Hypermedia APIs, crafting web service APIs, or any related topics a chance to get together in an informal setting to share ideas, trade stories, and show examples of current work. REST Fest is a unique blend of presentations and collaborative unconference goodness. The keynote sits directly in the middle of the conference schedule with hackday, workshop, session, talks, and 5-in-5 lightening talks surrounding it.
      The next RESTFest is September 26-27-29th, Greenville, SC.
